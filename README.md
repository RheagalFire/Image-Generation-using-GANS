# Image-Generation-using-GANS

## Machine learning Concepts Used
- Generative adversarial Networks
- Forward Propagation 
- Backward Propagation 
- Loss function of Generator and Discriminator

## ML libraries used
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- PIL 
- numpy
- keras

I have trained a simple GAN model to generate **digit 5**. The dataset used in of MNIST dataset which is included in the keras library. 

## Results

This image was generated using generator model of GAN 

Check out my [notebook](https://github.com/RheagalFire/Image-Generation-using-GANS/blob/main/Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks.ipynb) where i have discussed the details of dealing with the this kind of neural network. 
Also it can take a lot of time to run on cpu so it adivised to run it on kaggle gpu. 
I have uploaded the notebbok there as well.
